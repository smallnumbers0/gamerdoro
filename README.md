Gamerdoro takes the pomodoro technique and brings it to another level. Here at Gamerdoro, we believe that the traditional 25 minute work followed by a 5 minute break is NOT enough for both working time and break time. Instead we will be implementing a 50 minute working session with 25 minute gaming session. Of course, it is understood that not all games are 25 minutes long (ex: League of Legends, FFXIV raids, Valorant Competitive, CS:GO, etc) so there will be an option to adjust both study time and game time for these games. However, there will be no excuse for other games! 

We highly recommend the 50/25 timer for several reasons: 

1. The creator finds 50 minutes of continous work is usually when their brain begins to slow productivity so refreshing the brain by taking a break here will help you get rid of something they have experienced over and over again: MIND BLOCK.

2. It allows for an adequate reward. A 25 minute break is a true break. 5 minutes is only enough time to use the bathroom, or take a small bite of pizza, but not enough to let the brain fully reset for the next session. This will greatly impact productivity.

3. It is easier to track. A college student may study for an average of 5 hours on a given day. Thats 4 Gamerdoro sessions which translates to over 3 hours of studying, and a little under 2 hours of gaming! This is a good balance because we know as gamers, we are always itching to start that next game that's only a click away.

But WAIT... Aren't we losing 2 hours of study time in a 5 hour session?! That is totally true, but you need to give us your full trust that this technique will work! Don't believe us? Send this to your professor the next time you fail an exam, we'll take full responsibility.

At Gamerdoro, we believe in quality > quantity. Lets say you studied 10 hours where you were only productive for the first hour and maybe the second hour. The average Gamerdoro student who spent 5 hours in a Gamerdoro session that was productive for 3 hours and played games for 2 hours just outranked you on a basic Calculus test. They out there playing chess while you struggling on checkers.
